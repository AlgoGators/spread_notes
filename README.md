# Notes on Spread Trading

# What is Spread Trading?
- Spread trading is a trading strategy that involves taking a long and short position in two related securities. The goal is to profit from the change in the difference between the two securities, which is known as the spread. Spread trading is considered to be a less risky trading strategy than taking a position in a single security because the investor is hedging their bets that the spread between the two securities will change in their favor.
- A synthetic pair between related instruments​
- Often involves like instruments that carry some relationship to each other​

# How can I trade spreads?
## Pricing a Spread
The price of a spread instruments involves three components: the price of the first instrument, the price of the second instrument, and the spread ratio. The spread ratio is the number of units of the first instrument that are needed to equal one unit of the second instrument. For example, if the spread ratio is 2, then the price of the spread instrument is the price of two times the first instrument minus the price of the second instrument. 
## Pricing Formula:
$p_{\delta} = Rp_{a} - p_{b}$
## Net Notional Exposure
The net notional exposure of a spread is the difference between the notional exposure of the long position and the notional exposure of the short position. The notional exposure of a position is the number of units of the instrument multiplied by the price of the instrument. For example, if the long position is 100 units of the first instrument and the short position is 50 units of the second instrument, then the net notional exposure is 100 times the price of the first instrument minus 50 times the price of the second instrument.
## Net Notional Exposure Formula:
$NNE = (N_{a}\times)$
